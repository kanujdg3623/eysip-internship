Initially the hexapod moves in straight line.\nHexapod is fixed with a proximity sensor in front, right and left whenever it encounters an obstacle in\nfront, it checks the right and left respectively and turns accordingly. If there is obstacle in all directions\n, it turns around and moves. We wrote an Esterel interface, which provides various signals and helps\nfor the motion of the hexapod.\nProduct Perspective: This project which helps in controlling the motion of hexapod is really\nuseful in applications which requires bots in uneven surfaces, hilly areas etc.\nProduct Functions: The function is basically movement control of the hexapod. The final\nproduct makes the hexapod to move in different directions avoiding obstacles. The esterel interface\nwritten will be helpful in developing further applications on hexapod using esterel.\nUser Characteristics: While in the obstacle avoidance, user expects the bot to detect the\nobstacles and move accordingly to avoid them.\nConstraints: Accuracy of the proximity sensor to detect obstacles. Power consumption of\nhexapod. Accuracy of hexapod motion in particular direction.\nAssumptions and Dependencies: We assume that the readings are appropriate which depends\non accuracy of proximity sensor. We assume even size of legs. We also assume static obstacles.', '2020-05-20 11:39:47', '2020-06-08 11:04:03'),

Implemented on the Firebird V robot, it accepts the color of the ball it has to collect in the form of speech commands, finds the ball with the help of a camera, collects the ball and puts it in a basket. Such a robot can be useful in many scenarios, like ball collection in a tennis court or pool table.\nThis document gives a detailed report on the project implementation. This project is a re-implementation and extension of the Tennis Ball Collector (Anup Naik, 2010) project. The previous implementation was in Matlab and C, and did not support speech input, whereas the current implementation is in Scilab (open source equivalent of Matlab) and Esterel. Scilab is an open-source tool which is equivalent to Matlab. The SIVP toolbox of Scilab was used for this project. Some of the commands like \"bwlabel\" are currently not supported by SIVP. An algorithm was required to be developed for such commands in Scilab. The challenges faced and the solutions for them, while using this toolbox, have been discussed in the report. Esterel programming language provides a synchronous paradigm which is different from C language, which is comparatively a lower-level language. While doing this project we had to develop new signals which can be incorporated in the Esterel API for Firebird V robot. These include PICK, DROP, ROTATE (with parameters speed and angle), ZIGBEE SEND, ZIGBEE RECEIVE. These are described in the implementation section.\nPROBLEM STATEMENT', '2020-05-20 11:39:47', '2020-06-08 11:04:03'),

By that time it can cause huge loss of the\nproperty.\nIn this project, we aim to build an automated fire extinguishing system. It does not\nrequire any human presence. It can start fire extinguishing immediately so that the fire\ndoes not spread a lot and can be controlled easily. As soon as the fire starts, human fire\nbrigade is also informed to be on the safe side.\nIn the lab, we can use a candle or a lamp as a fire and extinguish it. But that does not\nmodel the real world fire. Real world fire has a characteristic of spreading which is\ndifficult to deal with in the process of fire extinguishing. This cannot be achieved by\nmodeling the fire using a candle or a lamp. We need to model the fire at the first place\nand then develop the system to extinguish it.\nThe major challenges in this work was how to simulate fire using electronic hardware\nlike bots. The next challenge was to schedule the fire extinguishing task such that the\nspreading fire must come to an end at some point of time. The scheduling involves how\nthe fire fighter should move on the arena in order to finish the fire. In this work we\nsimulated the fire using Spark V bots and ZigBee radios.
